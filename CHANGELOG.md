# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

Initial public Alpha release.

- Server-rendered forum with boards, threads, replies, search, moderation and
  English, Chinese and Russian locale resources.
- Tor Onion Service and I2P HTTP Server deployment model.
- CSRF, Origin/Host checks, Argon2id passwords, expiring sessions and SQLite
  permission hardening.
- Experimental privacy design. This release is not production-ready and does
  not provide absolute anonymity.

Known limitations and dependency advisories are documented in `README.md` and
`docs/`.

The current dependency audit has no fixed upgrade for the `rsa` Marvin timing
advisory and reports unmaintained transitive `bincode` and `yaml-rust` through
the Markdown syntax highlighting stack. Do not treat this Alpha release as a
clean security audit.
